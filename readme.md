# uLisp on WebAssembly

![Screencast](public/media/screencast.gif)

[uLisp](http://www.ulisp.com) is a programming language for microcontrollers and embedded devices. This project `ulisp-wasm` is a port of uLisp to C99 and WebAssembly that runs in the browser, on servers and the terminal command line.

See [the Playground page](https://eliot-akira.github.io/ulisp-wasm/) and [introduction post](http://forum.ulisp.com/t/ulisp-port-to-c-and-webassembly/1729) on the forum.

#### Current state

Early stage but the basics are working. 

- Parse and evaluate a Lisp expression. The runtime on Wasm has its own process thread with 64K of memory, and an event loop that optionally yields control to the host on every instruction.
- Pass the entire test suite in the uLisp builder.
- Run uLisp interpreter and REPL across platforms: plain C build, Wasm runtimes, Node, Bun, browser; Linux laptop, Raspberry Pi, ESP32.

## Changes

Based on [uLisp builder](https://github.com/technoblogy/ulisp-builder), [uLisp ESP32](https://github.com/technoblogy/ulisp-esp), [BL602 RISC-V fork](https://github.com/lupyuen/ulisp-bl602)

## Develop

Prerequisites:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) to run Emscripten in a container; or directly use `emcc` from [Emscripten SDK](https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk) ([install options](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html))
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) - JS runtime and build tool
- [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) - Optional: Compile to local platform
- [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) - Optional: Cross-compile to all supported platforms

See `package.json` for available CLI commands.

### Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eliot-akira/ulisp-wasm
cd ulisp-wasm
bun install
```

### Start

Build frontend app as static site, watch files for changes, rebuild and reload page.

```sh
bun run start
```

To run the above and develop/rebuild the C source in parallel:

```sh
bun run dev
```

### Build

Build for production with minified assets.

```sh
bun run build
```

Below scripts are ways to run functions in `build.ts`.

```sh
bun build.ts [command] (...options)
```

#### Build targets

```sh
bun build:node # Node.js target: Wasm library and CLI
bun build:site # Web playground site
bun build:web  # Web target
```

##### Cross-platform builds

Requires Bun. Optionally Clang for native build, Zig to cross-compile.

```sh
bun build:bun  # Single-file executable with Bun runtime
bun build:cli  # CLI/REPL as native C binary
```

These produce binaries in the `build` folder for the following targets.

- linux-arm64
- linux-x64
- macos-arm64
- macos-x64
- windows-x64 \*
- windows-arm64 \*

\* Windows support is partial: only Bun build on x64. REPL uses a `readline` library with terminal I/O, which doesn't exist on Windows. Possibly CLI could exclude the feature based on build target.

##### Experimental

```sh
bun build:wasi # Wasm target with WASI (WebAssembly System Interface)
bun build:zig  # Zig port of ulisp-c
```
